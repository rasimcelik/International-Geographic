    "",
    "The name Australia (pronounced /\u0259\u02c8stre\u026ali\u0259/ in Australian English[37]) is derived from the Latin Terra Australiscode: lat promoted to code: la  (\"southern land\"), a name used for a hypothetical continent in the Southern Hemisphere since ancient times.[38] Several sixteenth century cartographers used the word Australia on maps, but not to identify modern Australia.[39] When Europeans began visiting and mapping Australia in the 17th century, the name Terra Australiscode: lat promoted to code: la  was naturally applied to the new territories.[N 4]",
    "Until the early 19th century, Australia was best known as New Holland, a name first applied by the Dutch explorer Abel Tasman in 1644 (as Nieuw-Hollandcode: nld promoted to code: nl ) and subsequently anglicised. Terra Australiscode: lat promoted to code: la  still saw occasional usage, such as in scientific texts.[N 5] The name Australia was popularised by the explorer Matthew Flinders, who said it was \"more agreeable to the ear, and an assimilation to the names of the other great portions of the Earth\".[45] The first time that Australia appears to have been officially used was in April 1817, when Governor Lachlan Macquarie acknowledged the receipt of Flinders' charts of Australia from Lord Bathurst.[46] In December 1817, Macquarie recommended to the Colonial Office that it be formally adopted.[47] In 1824, the Admiralty agreed that the continent should be known officially by that name.[48] The first official published use of the new name came with the publication in 1830 of The Australia Directory by the Hydrographic Office.[49]",
    "Colloquial names for Australia include \"Oz\" and \"the Land Down Under\" (usually shortened to just \"Down Under\"). Other epithets include \"the Great Southern Land\", \"the Lucky Country\", \"the Sunburnt Country\", and \"the Wide Brown Land\". The latter two both derive from Dorothea Mackellar's 1908 poem \"My Country\".[50]"

    "Indigenous Australians comprise two groups: the Aboriginal peoples of the Australian mainland (and surrounding islands including Tasmania), and the Torres Strait Islanders, who are a distinct Melanesian people. Human habitation of the Australian continent is estimated to have begun 50,000 to 65,000 years ago,[24][51][52][53] with the migration of people by land bridges and short sea crossings from what is now Southeast Asia.[54] It is uncertain how many waves of immigration may have contributed to these ancestors of modern Aboriginal Australians.[55][56] The Madjedbebe rock shelter in Arnhem Land is recognised as the oldest site showing the presence of humans in Australia.[57] The oldest human remains found are the Lake Mungo remains, which have been dated to around 41,000 years ago.[58][59]",
    "Aboriginal Australian culture is one of the oldest continuous cultures on Earth.[60] At the time of first European contact, Aboriginal Australians were complex hunter-gatherers with diverse economies and societies and about 250 different language groups.[61][62] Recent archaeological finds suggest that a population of 750,000 could have been sustained.[63][64] Aboriginal Australians have an oral culture with spiritual values based on reverence for the land and a belief in the Dreamtime.[65]",
    "The Torres Strait Islander people first settled their islands around 4000 years ago.[66] Culturally and linguistically distinct from mainland Aboriginal peoples, they were seafarers and obtained their livelihood from seasonal horticulture and the resources of their reefs and seas.[67]",

    "The northern coasts and waters of Australia were visited sporadically for trade by Makassan fishermen from what is now Indonesia.[68] The first recorded European sighting of the Australian mainland, and the first recorded European landfall on the Australian continent, are attributed to the Dutch.[69] The first ship and crew to chart the Australian coast and meet with Aboriginal people was the Duyfken captained by Dutch navigator, Willem Janszoon.[70] He sighted the coast of Cape York Peninsula in early 1606, and made landfall on 26 February 1606 at the Pennefather River near the modern town of Weipa on Cape York.[71] Later that year, Spanish explorer Lu\u00eds Vaz de Torres sailed through and navigated the Torres Strait Islands.[72] The Dutch charted the whole of the western and northern coastlines and named the island continent \"New Holland\" during the 17th century, and although no attempt at settlement was made,[71] a number of shipwrecks left men either stranded or, as in the case of the Batavia in 1629, marooned for mutiny and murder, thus becoming the first Europeans to permanently inhabit the continent.[73] In 1770, Captain James Cook sailed along and mapped the east coast, which he named \"New South Wales\" and claimed for Great Britain.[74]",
    "Following the loss of its American colonies in 1783, the British Government sent a fleet of ships, the First Fleet, under the command of Captain Arthur Phillip, to establish a new penal colony in New South Wales. A camp was set up and the Union Flag raised at Sydney Cove, Port Jackson, on 26 January 1788,[75][76] a date which later became Australia's national day. Most early convicts were transported for petty crimes and assigned as labourers or servants to \"free settlers\" (non-convict immigrants). While the majority of convicts settled into colonial society once emancipated, convict rebellions and uprisings were also staged, but invariably suppressed under martial law. The 1808 Rum Rebellion, the only successful armed takeover of government in Australia, instigated a two-year period of military rule.[77] The following decade, social and economic reforms initiated by Governor Lachlan Macquarie saw New South Wales transition from a penal colony to a civil society.[78][79]",
    "The indigenous population declined for 150 years following settlement, mainly due to infectious disease.[80] Thousands more died as a result of frontier conflict with settlers.[81]",

    "The British continued to push into other areas of the continent in the early 19th century, initially along the coast. In 1803, a settlement was established in Van Diemen's Land (present-day Tasmania),[82] and in 1813, Gregory Blaxland, William Lawson and William Wentworth crossed the Blue Mountains west of Sydney, opening the interior to European settlement.[83] The British claim extended to the whole Australian continent in 1827 when Major Edmund Lockyer established a settlement on King George Sound (modern-day Albany).[84] The Swan River Colony (present-day Perth) was established in 1829, evolving into the largest Australian colony by area, Western Australia.[85] In accordance with population growth, separate colonies were carved from New South Wales: Tasmania in 1825, South Australia in 1836, New Zealand in 1841, Victoria in 1851, and Queensland in 1859.[86] South Australia was founded as a \"free province\" \u2014 it was never a penal colony.[87] Western Australia was also founded \"free\" but later accepted transported convicts, the last of which arrived in 1868, decades after transportation had ceased to the other colonies.[88]",
    "In 1823, a Legislative Council nominated by the governor of New South Wales was established, together with a new Supreme Court, thus limiting the powers of colonial governors.[89] Between 1855 and 1890, the six colonies individually gained responsible government, thus becoming elective democracies managing most of their own affairs while remaining part of the British Empire.[90] The Colonial Office in London retained control of some matters, notably foreign affairs[91] and defence.[92]",
    "In the mid-19th century, explorers such as Burke and Wills went further inland to determine its agricultural potential and answer scientific questions.[93] A series of gold rushes beginning in the early 1850s led to an influx of new migrants from China, North America and continental Europe,[94] as well as outbreaks of bushranging and civil unrest; the latter peaked in 1854 when Ballarat miners launched the Eureka Rebellion against gold license fees.[95]",

Australia adopted it in 1942,[102] but it was backdated to 1939 to confirm the validity of legislation passed by the Australian Parliament during World War II.[103][104]",

Melbourne was the temporary seat of government from 1901 to 1927 while Canberra was being constructed.[105] The Northern Territory was transferred from the control of the South Australian government to the federal parliament in 1911.[106] Australia became the colonial ruler of the Territory of Papua (which had initially been annexed by Queensland in 1883)[107] in 1902 and of the Territory of New Guinea (formerly German New Guinea) in 1920.

The Pilbara Craton is one of only two pristine Archaean 3.6\u20132.7 Ga (billion years ago) crusts identified on the Earth.[171]",
    "Having been part of all major supercontinents, the Australian continent began to form after the breakup of Gondwana in the Permian, with the separation of the continental landmass from the African continent and Indian subcontinent. It separated from Antarctica over a prolonged period beginning in the Permian and continuing through to the Cretaceous.[172] When the last glacial period ended in about 10,000 BC, rising sea levels formed Bass Strait, separating Tasmania from the mainland. Then between about 8,000 and 6,500 BC, the lowlands in the north were flooded by the sea, separating New Guinea, the Aru Islands, and the mainland of Australia.[173] The Australian continent is moving toward Eurasia at the rate of 6 to 7 centimetres a year.[174]",
    "The Australian mainland's continental crust, excluding the thinned margins, has an average thickness of 38\u00a0km, with a range in thickness from 24\u00a0km to 59\u00a0km.[175] Australia's geology can be divided into several main sections, showcasing that the continent grew from west to east: the Archaean cratonic shields found mostly in the west, Proterozoic fold belts in the centre and Phanerozoic sedimentary basins, metamorphic and igneous rocks in the east.[176]",
    "The Australian mainland and Tasmania are situated in the middle of the tectonic plate and have no active volcanoes,[177] but due to passing over the East Australia hotspot, recent volcanism has occurred during the Holocene, in the Newer Volcanics Province of western Victoria and southeastern South Australia. Volcanism also occurs in the island of New Guinea (considered geologically as part of the Australian continent), and in the Australian external territory of Heard Island and McDonald Islands.[178] Seismic activity in the Australian mainland and Tasmania is also low, with the greatest number of fatalities having occurred in the 1989 Newcastle earthquake.[179]",

Much of the northern part of the country has a tropical, predominantly summer-rainfall (monsoon).[147] The south-west corner of the country has a Mediterranean climate.[183] The south-east ranges from oceanic (Tasmania and coastal Victoria) to humid subtropical (upper half of New South Wales), with the highlands featuring alpine and subpolar oceanic climates. The interior is arid to semi-arid.[147]",
    "Driven by climate change, average temperatures have risen more than 1\u00b0C since 1960.

The governor-general, however, does have reserve powers which, in some situations, may be exercised outside the prime minister's request.

    "Australia's electoral system uses preferential voting for all lower house elections with the exception of Tasmania and the ACT which, along with the Senate and most state upper houses, combine it with proportional representation in a system known as the single transferable vote. Voting is compulsory for all enrolled citizens 18 years and over in every jurisdiction,[224] as is enrolment.[225] The party with majority support in the House of Representatives forms the government and its leader becomes Prime Minister. In cases where no party has majority support, the Governor-General has the constitutional power to appoint the Prime Minister and, if necessary, dismiss one that has lost the confidence of Parliament.[226] Due to the relatively unique position of Australia operating as a Westminster parliamentary democracy with an elected upper house, the system has sometimes been referred to as having a \"Washminster mutation\",[227] or as a semi-parliamentary system.[228]",
    "There are two major political groups that usually form government, federally and in the states: the Australian Labor Party and the Coalition, which is a formal grouping of the Liberal Party and its minor partner, the National Party.[229][230] The Liberal National Party and the Country Liberal Party are merged state branches in Queensland and the Northern Territory that function as separate parties at a federal level.[231] Within Australian political culture, the Coalition is considered centre-right and the Labor Party is considered centre-left.[232] Independent members and several minor parties have achieved representation in Australian parliaments, mostly in upper houses. The Australian Greens are often considered the \"third force\" in politics, being the third largest party by both vote and membership.[233][234]",

In most respects, the ACT and NT function as states, except that the Commonwealth Parliament has the power to modify or repeal any legislation passed by the territory parliaments.[236]",
    "Under the constitution, the states essentially have plenary legislative power to legislate on any subject, whereas the Commonwealth (federal) Parliament may legislate only within the subject areas enumerated under section 51. For example, state parliaments have the power to legislate with respect to education, criminal law and state police, health, transport, and local government, but the Commonwealth Parliament does not have any specific power to legislate in these areas.[237] However, Commonwealth laws prevail over state laws to the extent of the inconsistency.[238]",
    "Each state and major mainland territory has its own parliament \u2014 unicameral in the Northern Territory, the ACT and Queensland, and bicameral in the other states. The states are sovereign entities, although subject to certain powers of the Commonwealth as defined by the Constitution. The lower houses are known as the Legislative Assembly (the House of Assembly in South Australia and Tasmania); the upper houses are known as the Legislative Council. The head of the government in each state is the Premier and in each territory the Chief Minister. The King is represented in each state by a governor; and in the Northern Territory, the administrator.[239] In the Commonwealth, the King's representative is the governor-general.[240]",
    "The Commonwealth Parliament also directly administers the external territories of Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea Islands, Heard Island and McDonald Islands, and the claimed region of Australian Antarctic Territory, as well as the internal Jervis Bay Territory, a naval base and sea port for the national capital in land that was formerly part of New South Wales.[217] The external territory of Norfolk Island previously exercised considerable autonomy under the Norfolk Island Act 1979 through its own legislative assembly and an Administrator to represent the monarch.[241] In 2015, the Commonwealth Parliament abolished self-government, integrating Norfolk Island into the Australian tax and welfare systems and replacing its legislative assembly with a council.[242] Macquarie Island is part of Tasmania,[243] and Lord Howe Island of New South Wales.[244]",

    "Many of Australia's performing arts companies receive funding through the federal government's Australia Council.[384] There is a symphony orchestra in each state,[385] and a national opera company, Opera Australia,[386] well known for its famous soprano Joan Sutherland.[387] At the beginning of the 20th century, Nellie Melba was one of the world's leading opera singers.[388] Ballet and dance are represented by The Australian Ballet and various state companies. Each state has a publicly funded theatre company.[389]",

    "Actor playing the bushranger Ned Kelly in The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film",
    "The Story of the Kelly Gang (1906), the world's first feature-length narrative film, spurred a boom in Australian cinema during the silent film era.[390] After World War I, Hollywood monopolised the industry,[391] and by the 1960s Australian film production had effectively ceased.[392] With the benefit of government support, the Australian New Wave of the 1970s brought provocative and successful films, many exploring themes of national identity, such as Wake in Fright and Gallipoli,[393] while Crocodile Dundee and the Ozploitation movement's Mad Max series became international blockbusters.[394] In a film market flooded with foreign content, Australian films delivered a 7.7% share of the local box office in 2015.[395] The AACTAs are Australia's premier film and television awards, and notable Academy Award winners from Australia include Geoffrey Rush, Nicole Kidman, Cate Blanchett and Heath Ledger.[396]",
    "Australia has two public broadcasters (the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the multicultural Special Broadcasting Service), three commercial television networks, several pay-TV services,[397] and numerous public, non-profit television and radio stations. Each major city has at least one daily newspaper,[397] and there are two national daily newspapers, The Australian and The Australian Financial Review.[397] In 2020, Reporters Without Borders placed Australia 25th on a list of 180 countries ranked by press freedom, behind New Zealand (8th) but ahead of the United Kingdom (33rd) and United States (44th).[398] This relatively low ranking is primarily because of the limited diversity of commercial media ownership in Australia;[399] most print media are under the control of News Corporation and Nine Entertainment Co.[400]",

    "The meringue-based pavlova is generally eaten at Christmas time.",
    "Most Indigenous Australian groups subsisted on a simple hunter-gatherer diet of native fauna and flora, otherwise called bush tucker.[401] The first settlers introduced British and Irish cuisine to the continent.[402][403] This influence is seen in the enduring popularity of several British dishes such as fish and chips, and in quintessential Australian dishes such as the Australian meat pie, which is related to the British steak pie. Post-war immigration transformed Australian cuisine. For instance, Southern European migrants helped to build a thriving Australian coffee culture which gave rise to Australian coffee drinks such as the flat white,[404] while East Asian migration led to dishes such as the Cantonese-influenced dim sim and Chiko Roll,[405] as well as a distinct Australian Chinese cuisine. Sausage sizzles, pavlovas, lamingtons, meat pies, Vegemite and Anzac biscuits are regarded as iconic Australian foods.[406]",
    "Australia is a leading exporter and consumer of wine.[407] Australian wine is produced mainly in the southern, cooler parts of the country.[408] The nation also ranks highly in beer consumption,[409] with each state and territory hosting numerous breweries. Australia is also known for its cafe and coffee culture in urban centres.[410]",

    "The Melbourne Cricket Ground is strongly associated with the history and development of cricket and Australian rules football, Australia's two most popular spectator sports.[411]",
    "Cricket and football are the predominant sports in Australia during the summer and winter months, respectively. Australia is unique in that it has professional leagues for four football codes. Originating in Melbourne in the 1850s, Australian rules football is the most popular code in all states except New South Wales and Queensland, where rugby league holds sway, followed by rugby union.[412] Soccer, while ranked fourth in popularity and resources, has the highest overall participation rates.[413] Cricket is popular across all borders and has been regarded by many Australians as the national sport. The Australian national cricket team competed against England in the first Test match (1877) and the first One Day International (1971), and against New Zealand in the first Twenty20 International (2004), winning all three games. It has also participated in every edition of the Cricket World Cup, winning the tournament a record five times.[414]",
    "Australia is one of five nations to have participated in every Summer Olympics of the modern era,[415] and has hosted the Games twice: 1956 in Melbourne and 2000 in Sydney.[416] It is also set to host the 2032 Games in Brisbane.[417] Australia has also participated in every Commonwealth Games,[418] hosting the event in 1938, 1962, 1982, 2006 and 2018.[419] As well as being a regular FIFA World Cup participant, Australia has won the OFC Nations Cup four times and the AFC Asian Cup once\u2014the only country to have won championships in two different FIFA confederations.[420]",
    "Other major international events held in Australia include the Australian Open tennis grand slam tournament and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix. The annual Melbourne Cup horse race and the Sydney to Hobart yacht race also attract intense interest.[421] Australia is also notable for water-based sports, such as swimming and surfing.[422] The surf lifesaving movement originated in Australia, and the volunteer lifesaver is one of the country's icons.[423] Snow sports take place primarily in the Australian Alps and Tasmania.[424]"
